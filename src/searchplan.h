  Searchplan Module

  Defines a data structure for searchplans and functions operating on this
  data structure. Also defines a function to construct a static searchplan
  from a graph.

/* Search operations are categorised by a character as follows:
 * 'n': Non-root node.
 * 'r': Root node.
 * 'i': Node matched from its incoming edge.
 * 'o': Node matched from its outgoing edge.
 * 'b': Node matched from an incident bidirectional edge.
 * 'e': Edge.
 * 's': Edge matched from its source.
 * 't': Edge matched from its target.
 * 'l': Looping edge matched from its incident node.
 *
 * The index of a search operation refers to the index of the node or edge
 * in the LHS graph's corresponding pointer array. */

/* generateSearchplan traverses a graph in order to create a searchplan
 * using the following algorithm:
 * (1) Walk the graph in a depth-first manner starting at the root nodes. 
 *     Tag each item, including the initial root node, when it is encountered.
 *     If the next item in the traversal is untagged, tag it and append the
 *     appropriate operation to the searchplan. For instance, if we examine an
 *     outgoing edge of a root node, add the 's' operation to the searchplan.
 *     Once this step is complete, all connected components containing root
 *     nodes have been examined.
 * (2) Scan the node list of the graph, performing step 2 on any untagged nodes.
 *     Unnecessary if the input graph is root-connected.
 *
 * The depth-first search is performed by recursive calls to traverseNode and
 * traverseEdge. These two functions are responsible for checking if items
 * are tagged, tagging items, and adding new operations to the searchplan. */
